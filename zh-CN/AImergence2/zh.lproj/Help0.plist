        <string>欢迎您来到 Little AI</string>
        <string>您可以使用屏幕下方的按钮控制一个叫“Little AI”的可爱机器人。过关的条件是在10个回合之内夺得10分。</string>
        <string>在您玩的过程当中，您可以看到生成的称之为“交互”的彩色圆圈和方框。您的得分是最近的10次交互结果的总和。对的，只是最近的10次交互！</string>
        <string>在您获得10分之后，您会看到重播模式，您将会更好的理解交互的含义。</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>交互是一系列的命令及其相应的反馈信息。这些命令会通过他们的形状的不同而区别开来，反馈的信息通过他们的颜色区别开来。交互流称之为“迹”。</string>
        <string>To better understand the game, it is preferable to generally follow the order: 1- read the instructions, 2- win the level, 3- explore the "replay" mode.</string>
        <string>Drag the 2D robot to the right or to the left to shift to the previous or to the next level.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>Little AI finds the interactions more or less enjoyable or unpleasant. The points associated with interactions indicate the intensity of these feelings.</string>
        <string>Generate a pattern of enjoyable interactions.</string>
        <string>Tap an interaction in the trace to replay a previous command. The same command replayed upon the same object yields the same interaction. To replay an entire pattern of interactions, tap the "next command" several times (white shape that appears on the left when you tap an interaction).</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>Press and hold a command to change its shape. Press and hold an interaction in the trace to change its color.</string>
        <string>Change the shapes of the commands and the colors of interactions to recognize them. Shapes and colors are purely descriptive. They do not change the robot.</string>
        <string>You can also recognize interactions by the cries your baby robot makes. In this game, your ears can also help you!</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>In Level 4, Little AI cannot always avoid unpleasant interactions.</string>
        <string>Generate a pattern of interaction that contains as few unpleasant interactions as possible. </string>
        <string>Use different shapes for the commands. Display the enjoyable interactions in green and the unpleasant interactions in red. Don't think too much, your brain will see the pattern before you know it!</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>Experiment with each command alone several times in a row. In the trace, you will see that one command always yields the same interaction within a given situation (same shape and same color).</string>
        <string>This command allows you to observe the world without changing it. We call it an "observational command", and its resulting interactions "observational interactions".</string>
        <string>Use the color of observational interactions to avoid performing a strongly unpleasant interaction on the next turn.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>In Level 6, the commands have the same effects as in Level 5, but they have been rearranged in a random order, and are all initially represented by circles.</string>
        <string>It is left to you to attribute shapes to commands and colors to interactions.</string>
        <string>Display in green the interactions that are enjoyable or premonitory of an enjoyable interaction in the next turn, and in red those that are strongly unpleasant or premonitory of a strongly unpleasant interaction in the next turn.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>In Level 7, the commands have the same effects as in Levels 5 and 6, but the values of interactions are different.</string>
        <string>Tap the interactions in the trace to replay enjoyable patterns of interaction in the context when it is possible.</string>
        <string>When you replay a pattern, skip the observational commands to maximize your score.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>On Level 8, the commands have the same effects as in Levels 5 to 7.</string>
        <string>Now, however, one of the commands always yields the same interaction. This is a "non-informative command".</string>
        <string>Although non-informative commands always yield the same interaction, do not mistake them for observational commands.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>The commands have similar effects as in the previous levels, but they also transform the environment on the long term.</string>
        <string>Little AI must transform its environment until it can enact an enjoyable interaction on every turn.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>Level 10's world is the same as Level 9's.</string>
        <string>Let's see if you can tell the observational command and the non-informative command apart.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>In Level 11, Little AI can move forward and turn in a little box.</string>
        <string>It loves moving forward but hates bumping into the edges of the box.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>The box is even smaller.</string>
        <string>Scroll to review the last 100 interactions. Double-tap on an empty area to scroll back to origin.</string>
        <string>Press the score to see your number of turns.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>Level 13 offers the same commands as Levels 11 and 12 plus an observational command.</string>
        <string>Now Little AI really hates bumping, and quite dislikes turning. Fortunately, the box is getting bigger!</string>
        <string>Use the observational command to avoid bumping into the edges.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>Level 14's world is the same as Level 13's.</string>
        <string>As a player, you are in an analogous situation as a newborn baby that ignores the signification of its gestures and of its senses, or of a robot that ignores the signification of its actuators and sensors.</string>
        <string>You must learn to know yourself and your environment to live a happy life!</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>Little AI now has two additional observational commands that it can use to observe the edges of the box on its right and on its left.</string>
        <string>Use these additional possibilities of observation to avoid turning towards the edges of the box.</string>
        <string>The box is getting even bigger.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>You are in the same world as in Level 15 with the same commands initially uninterpreted.</string>
        <string>Little AI is a free open-source research and pedagogical project driven by enthusiast volunteers in collaboration with academia.</string>
        <string>If you wish to learn more about research in developmental artificial intelligence and about us, consider visiting http://little-ai.com.</string>
      </array>
      <array>
        <string>You reached the last level of series #0! Congratulations! It is similar to Level 16.</string>
        <string>If you found Little AI enjoyable or instructive, or both, please consider making a small donation.</string>
        <string>Your donations will support the creation of new levels. It will also promote independent and open-source research in developmental artificial intelligence.</string>
