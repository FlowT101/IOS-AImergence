"Excellent 1" = "现在您已经完成了1级！这里有两个交互的模式可以解决这个级别。在关闭窗口之前，尝试使用不同的命令序列来观察的您是否发现了这两种模式。";
"Excellent 2" = "漂亮！您已经完成了2级！卷洞窗口后的历史记录，可以看到您做了什么，并且可以在这个窗口开的时候，重播在历史记录中您连续点击的交互。";
"Excellent 3" = "请注意Little AI会在您历史记录中选择一个交互的时候，建议您下一个命令。您可以在每一轮中命令不同的历史记录中尝试一下。给出的建议命令不总是适当的，但是历史记录会帮帮助您确定那一条命令在什么情况下产生什么样的交互。";
"Excellent 4" = "Congratulations! You completed Level 4! Tap a successful sequence of four interactions in the trace to see why unpleasant interactions were necessary for enjoyable payoffs.";

"Excellent 6" = "Make sure that the color of the interactions matches the geometry of the tile with which Little AI is interacting: green for rounded sides and red for flat sides. The colors that you have chosen should reflect these physical properties of the world. Little AI exploits this knowledge to live a happy life!";
"Excellent 7" = "Bravo! When you play again a sequence of interactions by tapping them in the trace, you are re-executing a program that you have previously learned. This is how an autonomous robot can program itself!";
"Excellent 8" = "In this level, you can see that the non-informative command flips the tile without informing you on what side it is. Leave the interaction produced by this command in white because it does not convey any information about the physical state of the world.";
"Excellent 14" = "During the game, you can arbitrarily interpret the directions (left or right) of the rotate commands. This interpretation may be inverted from what you see in replay mode but that's ok. The real world, if it exists, is perhaps entirely inverted from the way you see it!";
"Excellent 16" = "You can win level 16 before figuring out the exact meaning of each command and interaction. The spatial representation offered by the replay mode will help you correct the inconsistencies in your understanding.";
