        <string>在第2.00级别中，Little AI可以敲击他左边和右边的小片。</string>
        <string>It can experience a delightful interaction in a specific configuration of the environment.</string>
        <string>Notice that one of the commands now can yield three different types of interactions.</string>

        <string>Level 2.01 is identical to Level 2.00.</string>
        <string>This series of levels illustrates the problem of learning the persistence of objects in the world. </string>
        <string>It involves using rudimentary spatial memory that may lay the ground for more complex spatial intelligence.</string>

      <array>
        <string>Little AI begins to manipulate a more complex object made of two different parts. </string>
        <string>We currently don't have algorithms that can play levels 2.00 to 2.02 automatically. If you wish to contribute to research in developmental AI, you may address this problem.</string>
        <string>You may also invent more levels that exemplify the problem of learning to interact with more complex objects.</string>
